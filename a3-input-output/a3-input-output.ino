/*
  Analog input, analog output, serial output

  Reads an analog input pin, maps the result to a range from 0 to 255 and uses
  the result to set the pulse width modulation (PWM) of an output pin.
  Also prints the results to the Serial Monitor.

  The circuit:
  - potentiometer connected to analog pin 0.
    Center pin of the potentiometer goes to the analog pin.
    side pins of the potentiometer go to +5V and ground
  - LED connected from digital pin 9 to ground

// These constants won't change. They're used to give names to the pins used:
const int analogInPin = A0;  // Analog input pin that the potentiometer is attached to

int sensorValue = 0;        // value read from the heat sensor
int outputValue = 100;       // value output to the PWM (analog out)
int analogOutPin = 10;      // Analog output pin that the blue LED is attached to

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the analog in value:
  sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);   
  // change the analog out value:
  analogWrite(analogOutPin, outputValue);

  // if the sensor is heated, change the out pin to power the red LED (pin 11)
  if (sensorValue < 430) {
    analogOutPin = 11;
  }
  //if sensor is cool, keep the power output going to the blue LED (pin 10)
  else {
    analogOutPin = 10;
  }
  
  // set brightness of LED
  outputValue = 255;
  // print the results to the Serial Monitor:
  Serial.print("sensor = ");
  Serial.print(sensorValue);
  Serial.print("\t output = ");
  Serial.println(outputValue);

  // wait 2 milliseconds before the next loop for the analog-to-digital
  // converter to settle after the last reading:
  delay(2);
