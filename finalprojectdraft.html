            <p>It's still pretty early in the quarter and I really don't know what else we're going to learn in here, so this is an early idea for my final project. I'm thinking of using an LED screen, two buttons, and a fan to create Your #1 Fan. The buttons are used to count up or down on the LED screen and whenever the number is 001, the fan turns on.</p>
